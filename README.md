# win10script
This is the Ultimate Windows 10 Script from a creation from multiple debloat scripts and gists from github. I also added Chocolatey and other tools to the script that I install on every machine.

## My Additions

- Dark Mode
- One Command to launch and run
- Chocolatey Install
- O&O Shutup10 CFG and Run
- Added Install Programs
- Added Debloat Microsoft Store Apps

## Modifications
I encourage people to fork this project and comment out things they don't like! Here is a list of normal things people change:
- Uninstalling OneDrive (This is on in my script)
- Installing Adobe, Chocolatey, Notepad++, MPC-HC, and 7-Zip


## To install, right click windows and open Powershell as admin
powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JJuLL')"
